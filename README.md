# deep-learning-challenge
This repository contains the code for the Module 21 Challenge. It sources code from DataCamp, Re-Thought, and the StackOverflow user umutto. There are two Google Colab files containing neural network models. One is the original version, the other is the optimized version. The is an analysis in a markdown file, and screenshots showing attempts to optimize the model. Note that multiple attempts to run even the same version of a model will not always result in identical accuracy calculations. It is entirely possible that running the optimized version of the model may result in the accuracy dropping below the accuracy achieved in one of the other attempts. Part of this may be due to the fact that the differences in accuracy are very small.
